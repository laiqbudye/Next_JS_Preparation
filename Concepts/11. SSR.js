SSR - Server Side Rendering
  next js allows to pre-render a page not at build time but at request time.
  HTML is generated for every incoming request.
  user requests for a page, next js fetches data for that page from an API, then HTML is generated for fetched data & it is sent back to the browser.
  
  When to use?
    when you need to fetch data per request & also when you need to fetch personalized data keeping in mind SEO.
