1. What is Next JS?
Its a React framework for production.

React:-
When we build any application with only React then its not quite possible to build a full feature rich application ready to be deployed for production.
Its just a JS library to build user interfaces.
It is responsible for only view layer of an application.
to build routing n all we need to add extra packages like react-router.
